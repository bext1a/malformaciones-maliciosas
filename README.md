## Features:

**Use chat commands to roll injuries:**

- /mmmm will bring up a dialog with all the tables

**Injury items:**

The GM can click on the Red Virus button in the name of the injury (in chat) to add it as an item to the target's character sheet

**Injury automation (requires midiqol)**

Automatically prompt for injuries on:

- Critically failed saving throw
- Critical hit
- More than half hp of damage
